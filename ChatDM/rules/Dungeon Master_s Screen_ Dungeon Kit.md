### Long Jump

Move 10+ feet, and jump a number of feet up to your Strength score. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance.

### High Jump

Move 10+ feet, and jump a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance.

### Suffocating

You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum Of 30 seconds).

If you run out of breath or you're choking, you can survive for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of your next turn, you drop to O hit points and are dying, and you can't regain hit points or be stabilized until you can breathe again.

### Concentration

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, its description specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required). The following factors can break concentration:

- You cast another spell that requires concentration.
- You take damage. Succeed on a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration, with a DC equal to 10 or half the damage you take (round down), whichever number is higher.
- You're incapacitated or killed.
- You're overwhelmed by an enormous distraction, such as a wave crashing into you. Succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration.

|:---:|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Perilous  | The area is dangerously worn and prone to collapse. Any impacts or damage to the structure, including from spells and other areas of effect, have a 50 percent chance of causing a collapse (see the Improvising Damage table). |
|  2  | Crumbling | Areas within the dungeon section are choked with rubble and have a 50 percent chance of being difficult terrain. Half cover and hiding places are plentiful.                                                                    |
|  3  | Neglected | One dungeon [trapshazards.html#](hazard) such as brown mold, yellow mold, or green slime is abundant.                                                                                                                           |
|  4  | Abandoned | Most of the dungeon is deserted and quiet as a tomb. Dexterity (Stealth) checks have disadvantage because any sounds stand out as unusual.                                                                                      |
|  5  | Secure    | Ability checks made to break down doors, open locks, or similar breaking and entering activities have disadvantage.                                                                                                             |
|  6  | Thriving  | The dungeon is heavily populated. Any loud noises or other attention-drawing phenomena require a check for Dungeon Encounters (see below).                                                                                      |

### Dungeon Encounters

Once during each day and each night that the adventurers spend exploring a dungeon, you can roll a d20 to see if an encounter occurs. On a 1, roll on the table below. You can use the Monster Motivation table to randomly determine a creature's goals.

|  d6 | Encounter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A lone, powerful creature appears! You choose the creature, selecting one with a challenge rating that is 1–3 higher than the level of the player characters. The creature lives in the dungeon or is passing through, and it is hostile toward the group only if they provoke it. |
| 2–4 | Hostile creatures prowl nearby! You choose the creatures, selecting five with a challenge rating equal to the level of the player characters. These creatures are either monsters native to the dungeon or hostile explorers.                                                      |
|  5  | A patch of brown mold, green slime, or yellow mold lies nearby.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  6  | A group of friendly explorers crosses the player characters' path. The explorers have 2d4 goods for sale that cost 1 gp or less, which you can select from the Adventuring Gear table in the Player's Handbook.                                                                    |
